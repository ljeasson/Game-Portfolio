                    Have you every played a game that made you feel something?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Was it sheer dread as an unseen horror approaches you from out of the darkness?
                    Was it remorseful regret from your decisions leading to the death of a beloved character?
                    Was it glorious triumph at snatching a well-earned victory from the grasp of defeat?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At Oxonian Games, we strive to create those kinds of experiences.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We want our player to enjoy playing our games and have fun, but we also want them to think, to feel, to question, to ponder, to wonder.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We believe video games can offer us experiences previously limited to our imagination.  They can bring us together by allowing us to empathize and connect.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We believe video games can be more than what they are.  That they are more than toys or means of escapism.  That they are more than their stereotypes.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We believe video games are one of the most enhanced means of artisitc expression. With books, you imagine.  With movies, you view.  With video games, you experience. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    An artists creates not because he wants to say something, but because he has something to say.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We at Oxonian Games have plenty to say.
